// swift-tools-version:6.0
//
// The manifest is Swift 6.0 so we can declare Swift Testing test
// targets, but `swiftLanguageModes: [.v5]` keeps the rest of the code
// out of Swift 6's strict concurrency checking — that's a separate,
// much larger migration. Test targets opt themselves into Swift Testing
// just by `import Testing`.
//
// Running tests requires full Xcode, not Command Line Tools.
// CLT 26.5 ships the Testing.framework + lib_TestingInterop.dylib
// (so the test bundle compiles) and a `swiftpm-testing-helper` binary,
// but the helper silently no-ops on Swift Testing bundles — invoking
// the test entry point is something Xcode's test runner does and CLT
// doesn't. `swift build -c release` works fine on CLT; only `swift
// test` is blocked.
import PackageDescription

// Framework search path + explicit link + runtime rpath for Swift
// Testing under Command Line Tools. swiftc doesn't add CLT's
// Frameworks dir to its default search path, the linker doesn't pull
// Testing in without `-framework Testing`, and dyld doesn't know
// where to find Testing.framework at runtime without an rpath. All
// three are pinned to the same CLT Frameworks directory.
//
// Harmless when CLT isn't installed — swiftc / ld silently skip
// nonexistent `-F` and `-rpath` paths.
